          <h2>What is blood cancer?</h2>
          <p>Blood cancer is the generic term for malignant diseases of the bone marrow or blood-forming system, in which normal blood formation is disturbed by the uncontrolled multiplication of malignant blood cells. Because of these cancer cells, the blood can no longer perform its vital tasks, such as fighting infections, transporting oxygen or stopping bleeding.

            Curing blood cancer
            
            Blood cancer patients can often only overcome the disease with the help of a stem cell donation from a suitable donor. In the case of leukaemia and malignant lymphomas, the transfer of healthy stem cells is even the only chance of a cure.
            
            Leukaemia
            
            A series of malignant diseases in which there is a pathologically increased proliferation of immature and therefore non-functional white blood cells. Malignant lymphomas are divided into Hodgkin's disease (lymphogranulomatosis) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (lymphatic leukaemia) according to their different characteristics.
            
            Lymphoma, malignant
            
            Malignant alteration of lymphatic tissue with swelling of the lymph nodes and pathological enlargement of the spleen. Malignant lymphomas are divided according to their different characteristics into Hodgkin's disease (lymphogranulomatosis) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (lymphatic leukemia), which originate from the lymph nodes.

          <h2>How does a stem cell donation work?</h2>
          <p>Peripheral blood stem cell collection is safe and the most commonly used donation method today. Prior to the blood stem cell collection, the donor receives a daily injection of G-CSF for five consecutive days, to mobilize and build up the number of stem cells in the circulating bloodstream. G-CSF increases the number of stem cells in the peripheral blood, which are then obtained directly from the blood using a special procedure. The process is similar to a blood platelet donation that takes approximately four hours to complete.

          <h2>Am I missing stem cells after the donation?</h2>
          <p>The body reproduces the stem cells within about two weeks. The procedure is comparable to a blood platelet donation and does not lead to a permanent loss of stem cells.</p>

      <h2>How does the search for a blood stem cell donor work?</h2>
          <p>Looking for a matching stem cell donor is like looking for a needle in a haystack. When a blood cancer or blood disorder patient depends on a blood stem cell transplant to survive, they need a donor whose tissue characteristics are a 100% match, if possible. When a person registers as a potential blood stem cell donor, their data is made available for worldwide searches in global donor pool of World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA). When a patient needs a blood stem cell donor, search requests are sent to the WMDA, and if a potential donor is found on the DKMS-BMST database, to match the patient, we will be informed and we will then contact the donor immediately.

          <p>Anyone who makes a blood stem cell donation for the benefit of other people or society as a whole, is covered by statutory accident insurance. This is legally required and covers anyone donating blood or tissue. If you are donating blood stem cells, you do not need to take out any extra insurance, as you will also be covered by this insurance. In addition, this insurance policy also covers the outpatient blood stem cell collection (PBSC), as well as your travel to and from the collection center.</p>

          <p>The doctors will try to treat the patient by alternative means, possibly with radio- or chemotherapy, depending on the illness. For many patients, however, a blood stem cell transplant from a matching donor is the only treatment offering any hope of a cure.</p>
